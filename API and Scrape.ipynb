    "\n",
    "The lyrics site, www.azlyrics.com, does not have an explicit maximum on number of requests in any one time, but in our testing it appears that too many requests in too short a time will cause the site to stop returning lyrics pages. (Entertainingly, the page that gets returned seems to only have the song title to [a Tom Jones song](https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tomjones/itsnotunusual.html).) \n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you call `requests.get` to retrieve a page, put a `time.sleep(5 + 10*random.random())` on the next line. This will help you not to get blocked. If you _do_ get blocked, which you can identify if the returned pages are not correct, just request a lyrics page through your browser. You'll be asked to perform a CAPTCHA and then your requests should start working again. \n",

    "## Part 1: Finding Links to Songs Lyrics\n",
    "\n",
    "That general artist page has a list of all songs for that artist with links to the individual song pages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Take a look at the `robots.txt` page on www.azlyrics.com. (You can read more about these pages [here](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/robots/intro).) Is the scraping we are about to do allowed or disallowed by this page? How do you know? \n",
    "\n",
    "A: For the AZ Lyrics page, it has a noarchive tag that is in place to have specific documents and information that they don't want to be viewable to everybody. With this in place, the information allowed to be scraped is allowed by the page. There is no information that is being blocked and disabled for us to pull the lyrics and artist information that is needed for this assignment. If AZ Lyrics did not want their information to be scraped or used, there would be request errors showing that we are blocked from being able to pull the data. \n"
